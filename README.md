# Holocene_PopSize_V_Technology
## Overview
This project uses Bayesian glms to model the relationship between prehistoric population size and changes in stone technology in southern Africa. Archaeologists have long thought that population sizes are directly related to fluctuations in stone technology. For instance, large stone tool should occur on local raw materials and only when people show low mobility. This more sedentary behavior, in turn, allows for increased population sizes. Therefore, when we see large stone tools, we should see more sedentary behaviors and larger population sizes. However, this hypothesis has yet to be evaluated quantitatively. The goal of this project is to use proxies for population size (i.e., radiocarbon density) to evaluate whether it is positively correlated with changes in stone technology from 15,000-2,000 years ago.

## Tools
- 'R'
- 'brms', 'rcarbon', 'OxCal', 'ggplot2', 'tidyverse'

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: contains input data
- `code/`: all analysis scripts
- `results/`: figures, tables, or output files

## Key Results
Our models provide no evidence in support of our initial hypothesis. That is, there is no relationship between population size and stone technological changes. Instead, when we focus on regional areas in southern Africa, population size and stone technology show distinct patterns. These results imply that technological change is driven more by local and environmental settings than it is by the population size. Future models need to acount for environmental components such as topography, climate, and targeted food resources to fully explain why we see changes in stone technologies.
